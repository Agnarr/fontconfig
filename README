Crud Factory Fontconfig
-----------------------

Differences from freedesktop.org Fontconfig:

    * Property priority order can be set in XML, for example:

          <priority>
              <name>family</name>
              <name>style</name>
          </priority>

      The default duplicates the hardcoded settings of freedesktop.org
      Fontconfig 2.8:

          <priority>
              <name>foundry</name>
              <name>charset</name>
              <name>family</name>
              <name>lang</name>
              <name>family</name>
              <name>spacing</name>
              <name>pixelsize</name>
              <name>style</name>
              <name>slant</name>
              <name>weight</name>
              <name>width</name>
              <name>decorative</name>
              <name>antialias</name>
              <name>rasterizer</name>
              <name>outline</name>
              <name>fontversion</name>
          </priority>

    * Preferred family/style and WWS family/style are kept distinct
      from the "normal" family/style and each other. For
      TrueType/OpenType fonts, the preferred names and/or WWS names
      need not be explicitly present in the font; Crud Factory
      Fontconfig will use fallback values. Thus, very often, the
      "normal", "preferred", and "WWS" names are the same.

      By default one works with the "normal" family/style. To work
      with WWS family/style instead, try

          <match target="scan">
              <test name="wwsfamily" compare="not_eq" target="font"><string></string></test>
              <edit mode="assign" name="family"><name>wwsfamily</name></edit>
              <test name="wwsstyle" compare="not_eq" target="font"><string></string></test>
              <edit mode="assign" name="style"><name>wwsstyle</name></edit>
          </match>

      This will cause family/style to be replaced with WWS
      family/style at scan time. For almost all current fonts (in the
      year 2010) this won't make any difference. What would make a
      difference is to use the preferred family/style instead of the
      WWS values; unfortunately GIMP, Inkscape, and probably many
      other programs would end up severely broken, because they make
      assumptions about font names that do not apply to preferred
      names.

      (Freedesktop.org Fontconfig even more severely breaks these
      programs, because it not only uses preferred names but also
      transforms names and styles into whimsical combinations that
      sometimes are identical to the actual names of other fonts.)
